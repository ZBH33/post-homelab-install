# Support

If you need help using this project, please use one of the following channels:

- **Questions & discussions**: Use the `Question` issue template or the Discussions tab (if enabled).
- **Bugs**: Open a `Bug report` issue using the template and include reproduction steps and environment information.
- **Security**: See `SECURITY.md` for confidential reporting instructions.

Support expectations:

- Provide clear, reproducible steps for issues.
- Include logs and versions when relevant.
- Be patient — open-source maintainers often respond outside business hours.
